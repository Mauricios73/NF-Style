# Animated Form

This repository contains a responsive animated form built using React.js and the Sass preprocessor for CSS. The design for this form was inspired by a layout I found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/): [Summerly Media Website design for the SMM agency](https://dribbble.com/shots/21459039-Summerly-media-Website-design-for-the-SMM-agency).
